# FindingGenesInDNA

In this repository, our aim is to find all genes in a DNA sequence. Basically, a gene is defined as a sequence of characters which start with a start codon and end with a stop codon. 

In the first assignment, all of the three java class has their own main method to test their own classes.

In a file the structure of the program is like the following:

* We have our methods that we are performing our jobs.
* We have test method which we test our functions.
* And static main function in which we are creating a new object and calling the test function.

Since all of the java classes have their own main functions, you can just test it with your own testing data.

In the first assignment, we assumed that there is only one gene and the stop codon is just TAA.

In a more realistic sense, there are three stop codon namely TAA, TAG, TGA. In addition, there might be multiple genes in a DNA sequence. In the second assignment, we implement our gene finding algorithm in a way that it also able to find multiple genes with stop codon TAA, TAG or TGA in a DNA sequence. 

The stringSecondAssignment content has a lot of functions in it, which you may want to use for your own purposes.
