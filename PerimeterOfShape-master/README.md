# PerimeterOfShape

The idea of this project is taken from a coursera course. However, all of the design of the algorithm and implementation belongs to me. For any given shape, it basically calculates the perimeter of the shape. Here, there are 4 java class :

* FileParse
* Point
* Shape 
* Runner


A shape is consisting of list of points. So, I construct a shape from a list of points or by simply adding a point to a point list.

I have also added the test data which classes use for testing purposes.

The main class of this project is Shape class which has a lot of methods for a shape in it.
